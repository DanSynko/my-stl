# My STL

This repository I have decided to make because it can powerfully improve my knowledge and understanding how the C++ works. I aim to upgrade my skills and be an advanced developer. So i am interested in creating my realises of STL-containers and some utilites.

## My goals in this global project:
*  **std::vector;**
*  **smart pointers from «memory» library;**
*  **std::allocator;**
*  **std::forward_list, std::list;**
*  **std::deque;**
*  **std::map;**

## Knowledges which i know by creating MySTL:
*  **RAII;**
*  **move semantic;**
*  **Rule of Three/Five/Zero;**
*  **placement new;**
*  **Big O notation;**
